## Geekbot Reports

Here at Expertizo, we utilize a service called Geekbot.
Geekbot is a program that runs stand-up meetings in text format in Slack. It helps our distributed teams organize and run stand-ups no matter the distance.

These reports provide critical information and updates from engineers that helps better improve engineering's context for overall work and progress throughout the GitHub organization.

There are **three** Geekbot Reports. 

1. The first one is a daily standup called "Standup Alpha". This prompts at 11 AM.
2. The second one is also a daily standup called "Standup Beta". This prompts at 5 PM.
3. The third one takes place once per month called "Monthly 1 on 1". This prompts at 4 PM on Last Friday of every month.

The below one isn't added in Geekbot:
1. "Weekly Progress". This needs to be report every Monday before 1 PM by everyone in their respective HR Channel.

### Standup Alpha Questions 1 & 2:
#### Specific and Measurable Responses

When responding to the questions from Geekbot it is imperative to be descriptive and avoid vague statements. **The response needs to be a measurable, durable change to the repository.**
Thinking and planning is acceptable as long as there is **actual verifiable output**.

For example:

>**What is your plan till day end?**

>“[I will fix the scroll bug on Contact Us Page](https://trello.com/c/PpZs436F/18-edit-short-not-working)”

>"[I will integrate forgot password API](https://trello.com/c/PpZs436F/18-edit-short-not-working)"

>**Provide estimations for each of the above tasks mentioned.**

>"5 hrs"

>"3 hrs"

>**Anything blocking your progress?.**

>"Forgot password API isn't working anymore."

are the correct responses, not:

>**What is your plan till day end?**

>“I thought a lot about how to fix `<issue>`”

>"Will work on `<component>`."

>**Provide estimations for each of the above tasks mentioned.**

>"5"

>"3"

>**Anything blocking your progress?.**

>"Not feeling well." (These type of stuff should be discussed in your respective HR Channels, not here)


### Standup Beta Questions 1 & 2:
#### Specific and Measurable Responses

#### Did you complete all the tasks, you mentioned in today's standup?

>"Yes/No"

#### If you didn't complete them, please mention with *each task* what caused the task to remain incomplete.

- Poor time management.

  - I have scheduled my day today to allocate additional time to complete the tasks I could not finish. As well as account for any potential time to correct mistakes that may be made.

- Too many code errors.

  - I believe that the main cause of the delay that caused me not to complete my plan was poor code quality. This lead to my PRs being rejected and sent back. This resulted in increased time to completion for each PR. I will make a concerted effort to improve the quality of my code.


### Monthly 1 on 1 Questions:
#### Specific and Measurable Responses:

#### What was your highlight of the month?
>"I had fixed 4 crucial bugs. Here's the list..."
>"I had presented a session on Nextjs SEO feature with the team."
>"I addressed issues and implemented fixes for Milestone 3, as well as other tasks outside of Milestone 3."

#### Were you on track with your goals this month?
>"Partially, refocusing efforts."

#### What was least clear to you in terms of team priorities?
>"Clearly communicated priorities."

#### If there was one thing I could do to help you, what would it be?
>"Occasional deadline challenges lead to task completion delays."

#### On a scale of 1-10, how happy are you with your work-life balance?
>"8/10"

#### How can we get you closer to 10?
>"Sometimes, on my side, sometimes there are delays in meeting deadlines."

#### Growth-wise, where do you want to focus next month?
>"I am exploring Nest.js and practicing on personal projects, planning for next month."


### Weekly Progress:
All are required to compile a list of whole week’s Standups along with the estimated hours and spent hours and send that in their respective hr channels by every Monday maximum before 1 PM.

Following template to follow is must:

**Weekly Progress Report**

**Week**: 29th Jan 2024 - 9th Feb 2024

1. [Fixed Patient Interactions as client said to focus on it first](https://app.geekbot.com/dashboard/) (This should be linked with the project management tool)
*Est. Hours*: 5
*Spent Hours*: 8
Reason of exceeding hours: I didn’t plan properly, after looking into the code, it took me time to debug the bug.

2. [Reviewed someone’s code](https://expertizo.slack.com/archives/C7KC9DJBC/p1706768419213499) (This should be linked with Github’s PR or Slack’s conversation)
*Est. Hours*: 2
*Spent Hours*: 2
*Reason of exceeding hours*: Not applicable
…

**Note**:
This isn’t added in Geekbot so this is your own responsibility to remind yourself (you can use [Slack /remind](https://slack.com/help/articles/208423427-Set-a-reminder)) to put this report every week before start working on Monday.
