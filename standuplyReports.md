## Dixi Reports

Here at Expertizo, we utilize a service called Geekbot.
Geekbot is a program that runs stand-up meetings in text format in Slack. It helps our distributed teams organize and run stand-ups no matter the distance.

These reports provide critical information and updates from engineers that helps better improve engineering's context for overall work and progress throughout the GitHub organization.

There are **two** Geekbot Reports. 

1. "Standup Beta": This prompts at 6 PM daily on working days.
2. "Weekly Progress": This prompts at 11 AM weekly on Monday.
