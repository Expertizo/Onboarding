## Organizational Email Account

On joining the organization, you will be provided an organizational email account like that 
> Rizwan.jamal@expertizo.pk

along with the password to configure the email account.

### Create a google account for separate session of Chrome
Open Chrome ->
  Setup a new Chrome Profile -> 
    Sign in -> 
      Create Account -> 
        For my Personal Use -> 
          Enter your information -> 
            Use you existing email ->
              Enter your company email & Finsing the process


### Configuration Of Email Account
Your organizational email account needs to be set up or linked with the Gmail account in order to receive emails.

Under your new chrome profile -> Go to Gmail -> Add Gmail to your Google Account -> Choose your gmail address (that will be a fresh Email linked with your organizational Google account) & Submit

#### Note

When you click “Add Gmail to your Google Account” and create a new Gmail address under your existing rizwan.jamal@expertizo.pk Google Account:

The new Gmail address will be attached to the same Google Account.

Your phone number, recovery email, and security settings of that Google Account will apply to both email addresses.

So you don’t need to re-verify everything separately — the Gmail becomes just another alias for login & inbox.

👉 Example:

- Google Account login = rizwan.jamal@expertizo.pk

- New Gmail created = rizwanjamal123@gmail.com

Both share the same phone number & password.

But again, your organization emails won’t come into that new Gmail inbox automatically — unless you configure them via POP3/SMTP.

Now you can use your company email (rizwan.jamal@expertizo.pk) to access Google services if needed (Drive, Meet, Docs, etc.)
