## Slack & Pull Requests

We have a dedicated Project's Slack channel: #project_<project_name>. Every PR should be posted in this channel, allowing for others to know that you have work that needs review. Communicating updates about the PR will happen in a thread attached to the original Slack message for the PR.

The process for posting a PR in Slack is:

* Post your PR in your project channel
* If you are the developer reviewing the PR, start a thread, saying: `@<developer_who_made_PR> reviewing`
* If the PR needs to be pushed back, the developer reviewing responds in the thread with: `pushing back to In Progress @<developer_who_made_PR>`.
* If all comments have been addressed, the developer responds in the thread with: `@<developer_who_made_the_comment> all comments have been addressed. Pushing back to Needs Review`
* If you have approved the PR, respond in the thread with: `@<developer_who_made_PR> approved`

**Please note that all discussion about the PR should stay in GitHub.** Threads are not intended a place to discuss the code itself. Slack is only used to provide more immediate feedback.

## Slack and Communication

All communication about projects should be in project channel. Do not use direct messages unless you are discussing something private. 
Also, if you require other team's inputs, it is important that all conversations and questions (no matter how small they seem) should be in #general. We work as a team and that requires sharing, being transparent, and allowing the whole team to have a chance to answer your questions and to learn from the dialogue.
